# PixelBot

This repository contains the work undertaken during my master thesis at the Computer Human Interaction for Learning and Instruction (CHILI) laboratory, EPFL.

The main contribution of my thesis is PixelBot: a low-cost and open source social robot which has been co-designed with and for children with the aim to teach them gender equality and respect.
