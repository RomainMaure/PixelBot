This repository contains the work undertaken during my master thesis at the Computer Human Interaction for Learning and Instruction (CHILI) laboratory, EPFL.

The main contribution of my thesis is PixelBot: a low-cost and open source social robot which has been co-designed with and for children with the aim to teach them gender equality and respect.
