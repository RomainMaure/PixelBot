This repository contains the work undertaken during my master's thesis at the Computer Human Interaction for Learning and Instruction (CHILI) laboratory, EPFL.

The main contribution of my thesis is PixelBot: a low-cost (≈300€), open-source, and DIY social robot, co-designed with and for children, and an associated robot-mediated storytelling activity aiming at raising children's awareness of existing gender inequality issues.
