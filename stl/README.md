# Mechanical design

The mechanical design is mostly taken from [Hagster](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3292767). Some of the parts were modified to fit with the specific hardware of PixelBot.


The main advantange of this design is that it offers pan and tilt degrees of freedom while being a parallel mechanism i.e. the motors are fixed at the base and therefore no slip rings are needed to bring the wiring through.

| [Payload plate](https://github.com/RomainMaure/PixelBot/blob/main/stl/payload_plate.stl)    |        1        |

All parts can be printed in PLA except the pinions for which ASA is recomended (to avoid thermal deformation of the bore due to contact with the motor shaft which heats up after long use).
